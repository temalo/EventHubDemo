# EventHubDemo
This is a very simple application that details how to send data to an Azure Event Hub
The application is currently configured and hard-coded to send data to my instance of the Caesars Demo Azure Event hub.
To modify, simply change the connection string referenced by the EventHubConnectionString variable and then change the 
EventHubName variable to point to the name of the event hub created within the namespace.
